Min Max Tic Tac Toe game with access database

This is a tic tac toe game that I developed to learn C#.

It uses an access database ".mdb" originally I used an ".accdb" but when I tested it on another computer it didn't recognize that file extension so I believe this may be an issue depending on what version of access you have installed.

The game isn't really impressive, this was more of a project to learn how to interact with C#. It also has a min max algorithm to make it a little more entertaining to play with. And I like AI.

So if you are in a similar boat, want to learn C# or are trying to hook up to a local Access database, I hope this small project can help you.


Heads up you will deffinitely have to change the path of the database file, unless you have the exact same name and folder structure as me.
